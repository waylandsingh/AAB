# Modelling Groundworker Visibility to Agricultural Aircraft

Preventing low-airspace accidents and unintentional chemical exposure is an important aspect of work in Agricultural health and safety.
This effort serves to provide a means of predicting the visibility of ground-based visual aids to inform nearby agricultural aviation (i.e. 'crop dusters') of low-airspace aviation('drones') and ground-worker opertions, preventing crashes and exposure incidents.
